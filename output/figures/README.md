# Scope

This directory contains some figures related with the results for 
  reflected light exoplanets. This output is optional. 
  The bar plot is equivalent to the output stored in `output/csv/`.
  It uses the same information [output/csv/README](../csv/README.md), 
  and adds the estimated duration of the observation taking into account
  the observing scenario in the Roman Coronagraph. 
  See [`json/README`](../../json/README.md) for the available options, and 
`scripts/cgi_etc_rv_shortest_integration_time.py` 
  for more information.
