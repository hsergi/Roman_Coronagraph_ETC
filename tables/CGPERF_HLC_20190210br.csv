# Sampling = 0.1.  This replaces hlc_20190210b,  same design..., and its one of the representative case among 100 MC cases intensity run right before CDR. Although lots have changed again (for worse) since then (~April this year), its the latest calculation intensity have.  The resolution has been increased per someones asking. -Hanying Zhou, October 11, 2021,,,,,,,
